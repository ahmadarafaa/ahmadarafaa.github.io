## Who I Am

I'm a DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on **automation**, **problem-solving**, and **system reliability**. I enjoy simplifying complex infrastructure, optimizing deployments, and sharing practical lessons from real-world experience.

## What You'll Find Here

I write about DevOps best practices, production issues and solutions, CI/CD workflows, and infrastructure strategies. My blog is a mix of insights, tutorials, and reflections — with the occasional humorous take on life in DevOps.

I believe in keeping things **simple**, **reliable**, and **well-documented**. I'm passionate about continuous learning and mentoring others in the tech community.
